### CSE 7202c Statistics and Probability in Decision Modeling
This four day module is aimed at teaching the most widely used statistical techniques in Data
Science.
### Days 1 & 2
You will learn two very powerful techniques, viz., Linear Regression and Logistic Regression,
which are used to solve problems in Prediction and Classification.
Math refresher on calculus and gradient descents and arriving at suboptimal or
optimal solution.
Relationship between multiple variables: Regression (Linear, Multivariate Linear
Regression) in prediction.
Least squares method.
Identifying significant features, feature reduction using AIC, multi-collinearity check,
observing influential points, etc.
Checking and validating linear fit, model assumptions and taking actions
Hands-on R session on Logistic Regression using a business case. Types of error
measures to look for. ROCR.
Logistic Regression in classification; output interpretations

###  Day 3
A powerful approach to analyze financial data and other forms of data based on their time
dependent past values is known as the Time series analysis. On Day 3, the focus is on
analyzing and understanding Time Series with financial markets as the case study.
Trend analysis
Cyclical and Seasonal analysis
Smoothing; Moving averages; Auto-correlation; ARIMA
VaR; Applications of Time Series in financial markets

### Day 4
The primary focus is to learn important techniques in machine learning, classification and
data analysis. On this day, another powerful technique – Naïve Bayes classifier – and a graph
based approach – Bayesian Belief Nets – are taught.
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE); Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) Estimation,
Naïve Bayes classification
Bayesian Belief Nets and difference in assumption when compared to Naïve Bayes
classification method.
Hands-on implementation in R
